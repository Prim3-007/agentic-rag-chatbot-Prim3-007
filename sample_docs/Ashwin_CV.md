• Engineered agentic workflows and reasoning logic via MMR to mitigate LLM hallucinations, delivering 97% accuracy.
• Developed automated ETL pipelines ensuring data integrity and observability, establishing 1:1 verified source mapping.
• Partnered with cross-functional stakeholders to build a production-grade system, integrating the AI backend with a React (TypeScript) frontend using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and TanStack Query.

Goupbrod | Software Developer | Indore, India | July 2022 – June 2023
• Launched a scalable recommendation engine analyzing 50K+ profiles, improving match precision by 30% to directly enhance business performance.
• Designed a multilingual real-time ETL pipeline for data validation, significantly reducing onboarding time.
• Led stakeholder management by building full-stack dashboards to visualize model metrics, empowering leadership to optimize conversion strategies.

PROJECTS
Financial Regime Detection System (Python, HMM, Streamlit) | 2025
• Engineered a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using the Baum-Welch algorithm to classify non-stationary regimes for reliable forecasting.
• Reduced false predictive signals by 25% via noise-resistant filters, delivering high-fidelity predictive insights.
• Designed a real-time dashboard visualizing probability matrices to drive data-driven strategy and action complex model outputs.

Large-Scale Transit Equity Analysis (Python, Scikit-learn, PCA) | 2024
• Processed 1.2M+ complex geospatial and demographic records, demonstrating capacity for large-scale data ingestion.
• Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) to identify systemic gaps within demographic datasets.
• Architected interactive spatial visualizations enabling cross-functional stakeholders to implement data-driven resource allocation.

Transformer Reliability & Fault-Tolerance Benchmark (CuPy, CUDA) | 2024
• Architected a benchmark suite quantifying LLM reliability and degradation under simulated faults to ensure enterprise robustness.
• Engineered fault-injection kernels using CuPy, achieving a 4x throughput increase via GPU acceleration.
• Conducted sensitivity mapping to harden models for high-stakes environments, translating results into enterprise deployment standards.
